Version 2.05:
- added useability options. 
- fixed some minor bugs.

Version 2.04:
- new random model: If the reads are expected to include barcodes, I simply add another N{x} barcode. Reads which do not have the barode will use this HMM.   


Version 2.03:
- Several bugfixes:
        - crashed when linkers were longer than 32 nucleotides. 
        - nuc_code array was set to length 255 not 256 

Version 2.01:

- added simple read filtering by matching to a reference, 
- added better support for partial segments ( 5' and 3' adapters)
- more input checking...
